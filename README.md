# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of the analysis: 
The company Pewlett Hackard is conducting an HR analysis to examine the number of employees eligible for retirement. By identifying the employees likely to retire in the next couple years as well as their positions within the company, HR can better forecast how many new employees to recruit and what types of positions will need to be filled. Preparing for these workforce trends will ensure that the company's staffing remains stable during this period of transition.

## Results: 
The analysis revealed a few main trends:
 - The most common titles for retirement-eligible employees are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. This pattern makes sense, since employees who have been in the workforce the longest typically have the most senior levels of experience.

 - Because the company will be losing so many senior-level employees, it is wise to create a mentorship program that connects workers who are about to retire with the next cohort of potential leaders. To examine this, we filtered the employee data to just those employees born in 1965 (ten years younger than the retirement-elgible employees born between 1952 and 1955). There are about 1550 employees born in the year 1965. While it will be helpful to provide mentorship and professional development opportunities to this cohort, this will not replace the 72,000 employees eligible for retirement. 

## Summary: 

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There are 72,458 employees listed in our table of unique values for retirement-eligible employees. That is a significant number of roles to fill over a period of a few years, so Pewlett Hackard must begin to recruit immediately.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are only 1550 employees eligible for the mentorship program. Since the number of retirement-eligible employees greatly exceeds this number, the company should have no issues finding a sufficient number of retirement-ready mentors available to teach the next generation. However, the number of employees in the mentorship program is nowhere near sufficient to replace the number of senior-level staff who are about to retire.
