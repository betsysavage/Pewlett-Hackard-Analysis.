# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of the analysis: 
The company Pewlett Hackard is conducting an HR analysis to examine the number of employees eligible for retirement. By identifying the employees likely to retire in the next couple years as well as their positions within the company, HR can better forecast how many new employees to recruit and what types of positions will need to be filled. Preparing for these workforce trends will ensure that the company's staffing remains stable during this period of transition.

## Results: 
The analysis revealed a few main trends:
 - The most common titles for retirement-eligible employees are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. This pattern makes sense, since employees who have been in the workforce the longest typically have the most senior levels of experience.

 - Because the company will be losing so many senior-level employees, it is wise to create a mentorship program that connects workers who are about to retire with the next cohort of potential leaders. To examine this, we filtered the employee data to just those employees born in 1965 (ten years younger than the retirement-elgible employees born between 1952 and 1955). There are about 1500 employees born in the year 1965. While it will be helpful to provide mentorship and professional development opportunities to this cohort, this will not replace the 72,000 employees eligible for retirement. 

## Summary:
